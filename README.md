# Coding Quiz Challenge

* Click the "Start Quiz" button and you are immediately displayed the first question.
* Questions loop through all ten questions, informing the player when they are correct or incorrect.
* When all questions have been answered, timer stops, and the time remaining = player score. 
* Player is prompted to leave initials which is stored in Local Storage. 


## Some things that I was not able to figure out/get to...

* Timer does not deduct time when question is wrong.
* Local Storage saves the "High Score" as "undefined"
* "View High Scores" navigation link does not take you to a list of high scores.
